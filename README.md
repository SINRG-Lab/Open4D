# Open4D

Open4D is an open platform for **4D dynamic geometry**—including representation,
compression, processing, evaluation, and streaming of time-varying 3D data.

The goal of Open4D is to provide a shared foundation for XR, robotics,
teleoperation, digital twins, and autonomous systems.

## Structure
- `open4d/`   : Core data structures, IO, and metrics (stable public API)
- `modules/`  : Algorithms and research systems (e.g., TVMC)
- `apps/`     : End-to-end pipelines and demos
- `benchmarks/`: Reproducible evaluations and paper artifacts
- `examples/`: Minimal usage snippets
